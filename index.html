                        <p>Native Womens' History spans beyond what is recorded and what is recorded. The resources and information presented here
                            will begin at the 16th century and move through time, highlighting both past and present Native women. Few written sources
                            from Native perspectives are available. Nonetheless, there are historians who have managed to look past colonial narratives
                            of history to write informed and accurate depictions of these histories. This site will focus on various Native Nations across 
                            the globe, taking into account the fact that indigenous peoples' exist worldwide and have different experiences under
                            colonialism and settler-colonialism.

                            This site will primarily focus on academic articles and books written across different disciplinaries. These disciplinaries include history, indigenous studies, anthropology, american studies,
                            personal memoirs, and personal anecdotes relayed by indigenous people. Given the nature of most of these resources and because they may not be widely known, summaries will also be available
                            along with brief analysis of the articles. Links will be provided and other resources will also be linked on the site. These resources may be books, podcasts, social media, videos, art, music
                            or other media that will help someone become more aware of Native American history. A good resource for those with access to University libraries would be the <a href="https://guides.lib.unc.edu/sb.php">
                            E-Research by Discipline Site on the UNC Library Website</a> where one can click on "American-Indian Studies" to get content related to the field.

                        <p>As someone who lives in what is now known as North Carolina, it is also important to recognize the tribes and Native organizations that exist in the state.

                            and organizations, but a map and more information can be found <a href="https://americanindiancenter.unc.edu/resources/about-nc-native-communities/">here</a> on UNC's American Indian Center website.
