            <p class="border-design">The above painting, by John Ghast, titled "American Progress" was painted in 1872. This painting 
                serves as the embodiment of the sentiments of the time towards invasion of settlers on Native land. The woman in white is leading
                the progress, with a bible in hand, with the intent to decimate the Native population and bring about the values of settlers which
                included religion. The painting is also interesting in that it feminizes the invasion of Turtle Island, and this will be a common
                theme among the colonial documents and testaments of this time. Women in particular had very distinct experiences during colonialism
                and these experiences were complicated, especially when it came to religion. This page will serve as resevoir for a variety of texts
                that showcase women's engagements with colonialism and religion.

        <div class="rel-para">
            <p class="border-design">Religion is an instrumental part of Native women’s interactions with settlers and as a part of colonialism that was used by white narratives to paint Native women, and Native people as a whole, as people who were molded to fit white ideals of language, culture, gender, and sexuality. The reality is that Native women were not silent actors–they actively engaged with religion and understood the changes taking place that would threaten their power and community as a result of colonialism. Hasinai, Iroquois, and Cherokee women’s experiences with religion were shaped by their respective cultural and spiritual beliefs that influenced the adoption of Christian religious beliefs, and took on many forms that sought to empower their identities. These women reshaped the importance of their traditionally held roles and responsibilities within their communities in response to their experiences with colonialism as it progressed over time, and as religion was incorporated into the mechanisms of colonialism. </p>

            <h5 class="border-design myth-header">Breaking Myths about Native Women</h5>
            <p class="border-design myth-intro">These articles are dedicated to breaking myths about famous Native women in popular culture and myths about who they were, as well as figures related to them. Sacagawea, Pocahontas, and John Smith are notoriously known for their popularity in the American conscious. This conscious tends to paint the history of Native women as voluntary, enthusiastic colloborators of settlers and the creation of a new nation. However, these articles push against these sentiments by showcasing how settler narratives co-opt the history of Native women to support their version of history that does not acknowledge the pain and violence that went hand-in-hand with the invasion of Turtle Island.</p>
