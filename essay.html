            <p class="essay-design">Colonialism evolved over time to include the infrastructure of a settler society and religion was a central aspect of that development. From early contact and diplomatic practices among the Spanish and Hasinai people in the late 17th century to mission schools in the 19th century, engagements with religion transformed and eventually became a tool for the impediment of Native culture, beliefs, and ways of life (Barr). However, this narrative was not completely controlled by settlers and indigenous people were passive victims of colonialism that affected their lives and societies. Native women were keenly aware of these changes and the threats to the power they held as women through kinship authority, community contributions, and as diplomats. Because of how colonialism and white settlement unfolded over time, it is important to examine religious interactions over time as it developed methods of attempting to disrupt indigenous identity and its impact on Native women. 
           </p>
           <p class="essay-design">An example of early religious engagements involve the Caddo people of the Hasinai confederacy in the late 17th century. Hasinai engagements with Spanish Catholicism were defined by diplomatic practices and emphasized the importance of women as symbols of peace (Barr). When engaging with the Spanish, contact rituals were often performed and notably, Hasinai women and children accompanied Hasinai men in these first meetings (Barr 407). Women were central to diplomacy and in early engagements, that diplomacy also shaped obligatory Spanish participation in Hasinai customs as well as Hasinai perceptions of Spanish Catholicism. Hasinai people viewed the Spanish use of images of the Virgin Mary as a way to account for the lack of women in their party and paid respect to her image by attending mass and offering carvings (Barr 412). </p>
           <p class="essay-design">Contrastingly, Spanish perceptions of Hasinai women directly contradicted Hasinai understandings of respecting and giving tribute to women as a diplomatic practice. Religion played a significant role in the characterization of Hasinai women as “Eve-like figures who enticed men to sin, if not destruction” (Barr 427). Spanish views of modesty and gender norms characterized Hasinai women as readily sexually available but only because of male Hasinai control over that perceived availability; in actuality, Hasinai women held authority over their own sexuality and their honor was not derived from their sexual activity (423). Gender’s place in Hasinai and Spanish diplomatic relations relied on women as symbols of peace and their connection to Catholicism’s Virgin Mary. However, despite their involvement in diplomatic practices, Hasinai women were subject to Spanish perceptions of their appearance and character, heavily shaped by religious rhetoric that painted them as sinful, sexual figures that warranted the Spanish to exert dominance through rape and assault (Barr 428).
            </p>
            <p class="essay-design">The abuse Hasinai women suffered demonstrates the role that colonialism played and how differences of gender perceptions and understandings of sexuality resulted in harm to Native women. Despite that, their connection to Hasinai men and the authority they held through food distribution, prompted insistent and furious action against the Spanish for their actions against Hasinai women, resulting in their expulsion from the area and Hasinai conditions that would not accept them “without the female contingent they believed would keep soldiers in line” (Barr 430). Hasinai women were the victims of Spanish assault but they were not powerless; their honor through agricultural authority and community contributions emphasized their power and importance in Hasinai society, and resulted in a physical fight against colonialism. </p>
            <p class="essay-design">Other pushes against colonialism in the late 17th century took on more subtle forms and in the case of Kateri Tekakwitha, that push was a devotion to Catholicism that demonstrated the blended adoption of religious beliefs that were informed by Iroquois women’s understanding of gender within their own community and by a sense of kinship. The similarities between Iroquois religious beliefs and Catholic religious beliefs formed the basis for the formation of a syncretic religion that reinforced already existing Iroquois views of gender and delegated control to Iroquois people who adopted beliefs based on those views (Shoemaker 52). Kateri Tekakwitha is a unique religious figure to examine because she was given the status of a saint, but her path to that status was prominently influenced by colonial narratives of who she was and the nature of her devotion to Catholicism. Like other Iroquois women and men, a prominent aspect of her religious practice involved extreme self-mortification and virginity (Shoemaker 54). However, because it was a widespread practice among the Iroquois people who adopted Catholic religious beliefs, white missionaries found it necessary to draw a distinction that labeled only her devotion as holy (57). In doing so, the missionaries sought to use her as an example of successful conversion that stripped her of any association with “godless” Iroquois people and culture. Regardless of that effort, Iroquois women maintained Iroquois beliefs that prompted a unique adoption of religious beliefs that was not under the control of missionaries. </p>
            <p class="essay-design">In regards to Catholicism, the prominence of female religious figures could have resulted in an inclination of Iroquois women to adopt Catholic religious beliefs as they were already familiar with female power and authority within their own society (Shoemaker 51) . Comparably, the actual practice of Catholicism and associated activities by Iroquois women could be seen as resulting from an awareness of an increase in patriarchal values. Tekakwitha and other women wanted to create their own female religious organizations to assert power and authority that they realized were associated with women who were respected by their surrounding community (Shoemaker 52). This motive might have also been accompanied by community values and values of kinship between Iroquois women who adopted Catholic beliefs, and who might have been ostracized by non-Christian Iroquois people.</p>
            <p class="essay-design">Iroquois women also saw potential in Catholicism’s reverence for virginity as a way to maintain power even in a religion that championed male authority over women’s existence and bodies. For instance, Tekakwitha successfully avoided multiple instances of possible marriage by espousing her devotion to Jesus Christ (Shoemaker 54). In regards to Iroquois beliefs, abstinence was seen as a way to clear the mind and to demonstrate strength (Shoemaker 64). This familiarity informed the later perception of abstinence as a way to maintain power and command respect from men that they otherwise would not be in a position to garner. For Iroquois women, the adoption of Catholic religious beliefs was not a simple matter of conversion as a result of accepting settler ideas that they were in need of “civilization,” rather their adoption was the result of a clear understanding of colonialism and religion, and how they were impacted as women. </p>
            <p class="essay-design">Earlier engagements with Christianity, specifically Catholicism, seemed to be marked by localized efforts by missionaries. This contrasts the early 19th century that was marked by the establishment of a new nation called the “United States” and its government that sought to increase white settlement on Native land. The resulting impending removal of Native people from their original lands and an organized national effort to force white settler narratives of “civilization” onto Native people functioned as predominant aspects of settler colonialism. Mission schools in several Native nations were an important example of this effort to “civilize” Native communities through their children. Christianity was now the focus of those efforts and the images that white settlers promoted were ones that heavily celebrated Native children who had converted to Christianity and that involved racial markers of a “civilized” person. Catharine Brown’s life is an example of those narratives and the ways in which people characterized her in regards to her appearance and personhood. Cherokee school girls who wrote letters to various people in the early late 1820s also provide insight into the ways in which they were impacted by mission schools. 
            </p>
            <p class="essay-design">However as was in Kateri Tekakwitha’s experience, Catharine Brown and other Cherokee school girls further exemplify complex interactions with Christianity that were not accompanied by a complete dissonance from Cherokee beliefs and culture, and instead demonstrated that their Cherokee identity influenced their religious identities. Cherokee religious beliefs and Christian religious beliefs were different in that Cherokee people did not believe they were “innately sinful, and death did not hold the promise of reward or punishment for actions in this life” (Perdue 80). Given these differences, Catharine’s particular experience with Christianity and her community oriented faith takes on a different context than white narratives. While she may have adopted the beliefs of innate sin and reward or punishment after death, the nature of her religious practice was noticeably influenced by Cherokee values and beliefs. This experience was also nuanced due to the ostracization she faced because of her Christian identity. Despite that divide and in line with community and kinship oriented Cherokee values, Catharine possessed a strong wish for her community to embrace Christianity because of the fear she felt for them as being “on the brink of destruction” (Perdue 81). Catharine, like Kateri and other Catholic Iroquois women, embraced a Christian community whom she felt deeply connected to and wrote about in ways that clearly demonstrate her love for them: “I think of you every day, and long to see you once more in this world…I hope, if we may not meet in this world, we may meet in heaven, where we will never be separated” (Perdue 81). Catharine embraced Christianity in ways that illustrate the influence of her Cherokee beliefs and that positioned her as a community figure. 
            </p>
            <p class="essay-design">Taking into account the changes in the Cherokee nation also contextualizes Catharine’s Christian faith and emphasizes the ways in which Native women continued to seek ways to maintain authority despite increasing patriarchal tendencies in their respective communities. The Cherokee nation in particular barred women from political participation–pressured by settler colonial narratives of power that reinforced male dominance in political matters (Perdue 83). Christianity also placed women in a position below the authority of men, but Cherokee women may have acknowledged avenues of power that could result from a devotion to the religion (Perdue 83.) Similarly, Cherokee school girls also recognized the power they had through Christianity when writing letters to white people about the issue of Native removal from their lands. Cherokee school girls often talked about religion and their faith as evidence that they were now “civilized” and that other Cherokee people could also be “civilized” to meet the standards of a white settler society, and to avoid removal (Cherokee School Girls). 
            </p>
            <p class="essay-design">They understood well the power of rhetoric that was involved in their letter writing and religion played a crucial part in formulating their arguments. In one letter written by Lucy Pherson, she wrote “if the Cherokees should be removed from their native land and be driven into a far country and separated from each other we cannot expect God will be our friend in this time of affliction if we have not given up our hearts to him” (Cherokee School Girls, 53). While Lucy believed that Cherokee people should embrace Christianity, the framing of that adoption was directly related to removal and that paints removal as a threat to the promotion of Christian conversion among Cherokee people. Catharine Brown and Cherokee school girls engaged with Christianity in ways that made sense to them in terms of Cherokee beliefs of kinship and community, but also embraced Christianity in a community oriented sense that lamented the fate of Cherokee people who did not convert to Christianity. The fear they felt is unique in that it is related to the realities of settler colonialism and Native removal; even while embracing Christianity, Cherokee Christian women and girls possessed a strong Cherokee identity that inspired concern and fear for their community that may have prompted their beliefs that conversion and assimilation would protect Cherokee people.
            </p>
            <p class="essay-design">Settler views of Native people are consistent in creating a dichotomy between settlers as  a group worthy of respect and Native people as a group that needed correction, but that correction was not to create equality, it was to reinforce notions of superiority. Colonialism impacted experiences with religion over time but one constant is evident in the case of Catherine Tekakwitha and Catharine Brown, and how missionaries sought to create a fictionalized image that suggested they were entirely stripped of their indigenous beliefs and culture. Native girls in missions schools were also subject to white settler narratives and characterized by non-Natives as examples of successful subjects of “civilization.” While Hasinai women only engaged with Catholicism through diplomatic rituals, they were also subject to settler perceptions and narratives like Kateri and Catharine were, particularly when it came to their sexuality. Despite the prevalence of settler colonial narratives and systems that sought to subjugate Native women, Hasinai, Iroquois, and Cherokee women and girls exerted their own influence and control of their lives in ways that go beyond the attempts to enclose them in narratives that erase indigenous identity.
